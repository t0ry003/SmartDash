## üîå Pin Connections

| BMP180 Pin | ESP32 Pin | Description         |
|------------|-----------|---------------------|
| VIN        | 3V3       | Power Supply (3.3V) |
| GND        | GND       | Ground              |
| SCL        | GPIO 22   | I2C Clock           |
| SDA        | GPIO 21   | I2C Data            |

> **Note**: ESP32 uses GPIO 21 for `SDA` and GPIO 22 for `SCL` by default in many libraries (e.g., Adafruit BMP180,
> SparkFun BMP180).

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Tips

- Double-check orientation: VIN is **not** the same as VCC on some boards.
- I2C lines (SCL/SDA) **must** have pull-up resistors ‚Äî many BMP180 boards include them onboard.
- BMP180 operates at 3.3V ‚Äî perfect for ESP32 logic levels.

## ‚úÖ Summary

You‚Äôve now wired your **ESP32** to the **BMP180** sensor over **I2C**. This setup allows you to measure:

- Atmospheric Pressure (Pa)
- Temperature (¬∞C)
- Approximate Altitude (from pressure)

You can now move on to uploading code using the Adafruit BMP085 or BMP180 library in Arduino IDE.
